<h1>JANATHAGARAGE</h1>
<pr>
    This film can be so amazing at times, that it takes your interesting to a new level altogether. But then, it suddenly becomes dull out of nowhere leaving you racking your brains. This Janatha Garage might give everyone a hand in repairs but they need a wee bit of repair themselves too. But guess what, we’d still tell you not to miss it, because the film has a lot more to offer thanks to the wonderful visuals captured by Tirru and soulful BGM rendered by Devi Sri Prasad.
